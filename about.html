        <h2>Magic The Gathering</h2>

          I started collecting magic cards at an early age. Not really
          understanding the cards or how to play the game. I just enjoyed
          looking at the art and collecting. Later on in middle school I learned
          how to play a format called "Modern" and started playing casually with
          friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Magic is a game that requires a lot of skill and strategy to play. You
          can build your own decks or buy pre-made decks and learn to play
          those. I started getting more and more interested in Magic the
          Gathering in my early 20's where I stated playing a format called
          "Draft". This is a format where you open packs and pull one card at a
          time while you pass the packs around the table to all the players and
          make a deck out of the cards you pull. This restarted the fire of
          collecting for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My most recent fascination is with a format called "Commander" where
          you pick one Creature card to be your main focus of the deck and you
          build your deck around the strategy of that creature. It is a 100 card
          deck and singleton format which means you can only have one of each
          card in the deck. These games can be very competitive but I tend to
          play casual, which can make the game last much longer but I think tend
          to be more fun. I enjoy playing Magic with my partner, sister and
          brother in law on the weekends.

        <h2>Live Action Role Play (LARPing)</h2>

          LARP is a group activity where you get to create a character with
          skills and statistics like health, mental fortitude and other
          attributes. Then you get to create how you want to be perceived by
          make uo and costume. A lot goes into work from making costumes and
          foam weaponry to the physical aspect of running around and engaging in
          roleplay and combat.

        <p>
          I started LARPing when I lived in Indiana, I joined a group called
          Dystopia Rising which was a Zombie Apocalypse style game. I enjoy
          doing special fx make uo and designing costumes a lot. Dressing up and
          escaping from the real world for a day or two over the weekend with
          some friends while getting some fresh air is great stress relief.

          My love for all things dark and spooky such as Halloween, Special FX
          make up, Killer Clowns and Graveyards extends past that into the
          unknown such as Paranormal and Occult Studies. At a young age I was
          gifted a set of Tarot Cards from my mother which sparked a big flame
          within me to learn all about the mystic arts and the history behind
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have read several books by authors such as Scott Cunnigham and Anton
          LaVey. Studying different Polytheistic Religions and alternative
          belief systems. As well as paranormal phenomenons.
